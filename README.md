Commander X16 Crazy Boulders game.

The original version of Crazy Boulders by Dustan Strakl was programmed
in Basic see https://github.com/Dooshco/X16-CrazyBoulders. Dustan has
lots of useful information on programming the X16 see his readme file.

This C version is an exercise in writing a game in C using the cc65
compiler.

Using Dustan's game design made it easer to consentrate onthe coding
while learning how game mechanics work.

This programme uses the excelent libX16.lib by Chris Love to provide
vload and load_file functions to provide the C equivilent of the
basic commands VLOAD and LOAD.

This programme also uses the EFFECTS.PRG by Dustan Strakl to provide
sound effects.
